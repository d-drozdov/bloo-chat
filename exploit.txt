The exploit that I found occured when users entered text that had
code that could be run into any text field on the app as before the 
way text would be changed was using .innerHTML specifically in the 
socket.on("message") function that we were provided with in the starter code.

A possible exploit was this: <img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookies);>
Other possible exploits involve wrapping JavaScipt code in the html <script> element as then this code 
could be exeucuted.
